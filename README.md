### Difficulties and interesting about your Netflix Show dataset 
#### Difficulties
1. One of the significant challenges is handling missing data. For instance, some shows do not have complete information about their release dates. This made it difficult to perform a comprehensive analysis 
   or predictive modeling.
2. Rapid Content Turnover: Netflix frequently updates its content library. The rapid turnover made it difficult to maintain an up-to-date dataset, as shows come and go regularly.
3. Multiple Genres: Shows can belong to multiple genres, making it challenging to categorize them neatly. This complexity can complicate genre-based analysis or recommendation systems.
4. Global Availability: Netflix operates globally, and the availability of shows can vary by region. Analyzing data without considering regional differences can lead to inaccurate conclusions.

#### Interesting Facts
 1. Most shows were added in 2021.
